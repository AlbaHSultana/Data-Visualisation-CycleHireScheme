# Data-Visualisation-CycleHireScheme
Exploratory and explanatory data visualisation of the impact of Cycle Hire Schemes a decade after the launch. Jupiter Notebook was used to analyse the data, where among with other Python libraries, pandas, matplotlib and seaborn were used too.

The source code of the data analysis and visualisation can be found in the PDF document 'CODE CHS' and the supporting report can be read on 'Report-key findings'.
